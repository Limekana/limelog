// A7 — movement pattern and equipment were closed sets of eight. Custom
// *exercises* were already supported, but each still had to be filed under a
// built-in pattern and a built-in equipment type, which does not survive
// contact with a sandbag carry or a Smith machine.
//
// The second branch widens the union without losing it: TypeScript still offers
// the eight literals as completions, while any other string type-checks.
// Spelled `string & Record<never, never>` rather than the more common
// `string & {}` because the latter trips @typescript-eslint/ban-types, and this
// repo lints at --max-warnings 0. The two are equivalent here.
//
// Nothing in the app switches exhaustively over either type — both are used for
// display, filtering, and injury-restriction matching, all of which work fine on
// an arbitrary string.
