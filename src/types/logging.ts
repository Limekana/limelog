 * a week, whose training load was invisible to the app and therefore to NCC's
 * Life Score.
 *
 * These ride the SAME storage as cardio — `activity_type` text, no sets, a
 * duration — because that shape is already exactly right for them, and because
 * `activity_type` has no CHECK constraint, so this list costs no migration.
 * What separates them is meaning, not structure: a practice is not cardio, and
 * filing it under "Cardio: other" would have quietly polluted every cardio
 * statistic. The split is therefore made where it actually matters — in the
 * picker and the labels — rather than by inventing a column.
 *
 * `otherSport` rather than reusing cardio's `other`: two entries with the same
 * stored value would be indistinguishable afterwards, and "Other" under
 * Training means a different thing from "Other" under Cardio.
