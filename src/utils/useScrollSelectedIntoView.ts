// v1.8 / ACT-6 — keep the active option visible inside a scroll-capped list.
//
// The language grids are capped at ~3.5 rows so a ten-language list can't push
// surrounding controls below the fold. That cap creates a trap: with the list
// scrolled to the top, a user whose device already resolved to (say) Hindi opens
// the picker, sees English/Suomi/Français, and concludes their language isn't
// offered. Scrolling the selected option into view on mount removes it.
//
// Attach the returned ref to the scrolling container. Options must carry
// `aria-pressed="true"` on the active one, which the pickers already do.
//
// Why not `scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })`: it was measured leaving the
// last row ~10px short. The effect runs before the self-hosted display font has
// swapped in, rows then grow, and the scroll position it computed is stale.
// So we do the math against live rects and re-apply after layout settles —
// once on the next frame, and again when fonts finish loading.
