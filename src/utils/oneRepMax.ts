 *
 *   Brzycki:  1RM = weight × 36 / (37 - reps)
 *     • Most accurate for low-rep sets (1-10).
 *     • Diverges sharply as reps approach 37 (denominator → 0).
 *     • Slight under-estimate at high reps.
 *
 *   Epley:    1RM = weight × (1 + reps / 30)
 *     • Most accurate for moderate-rep sets (5-15).
 *     • Linear, no asymptote — safe at high reps.
 *     • Slight over-estimate at very low reps (1-3).
 *
 * Convention here: use Brzycki for reps ≤ 10 (the strength range where
 * accuracy matters most), Epley for reps > 10 (where Brzycki gets unreliable).
 * Above ~12 reps, ALL formulas degrade — we cap the inputs and return null
 * for unreliable estimates rather than print a misleadingly precise number.
 *
 * All weights in kilograms. Caller is responsible for unit conversion at
 * the UI boundary (display layer formats lb/kg per user preference).
